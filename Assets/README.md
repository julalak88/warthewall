# UnityGoogleSignIn
This is a google-sign in application I've built in Unity using a YouTube tutorial. I've made my own tutorial on the subject after making this app so that it's easier for people in the future to make this application, and easier for me in the future to implement this functionality whenever I need to use this knowledge again.
